This repository contains my solutions for assignments received in the "Python For Everybody" online course.  
See the website: https://www.py4e.com/  
You can practice python, read the book and solve assignments.  
The course is taught by Dr. Charles Severance from Uni. of Michigan and is offered as a specialization on Coursera.  


This course is an opportunity for me to improve my python and programming skills :)  
This repo is mainly a documentation for myself, and an opportunity to get to know git and gitlab better.  

Feel free to browse and use the solutions, they have all passed the "Python for everybody" autograder.  
If there are any mistakes or notes for improvement, I'd be glad to hear about them :)
